# Laboratory Work 1

## Tasks

1. An encrypted message was intercepted that is known to have been obtained using a mono-alphabetic cipher. Applying the frequency analysis attack to find out the original message, if it assumed to be a text written in English. Bear in mind that only letters, the other characters remain unencrypted.

2. (Additional) Develop a program in one of the chosen programming languages that will receive the encrypted text as input, will analyze and display the frequency of each character and will have a mechanism to substitute the encrypted character with the appropriate one from the classical alphabet. The program must provide an intuitive user interface
